# UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy?

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to begin the journey of learning JavaScript by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and vizualization. In this project I will assist Dana, a data journalist, as she write an article about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. According to Dana her hometown is famous for its UFO sightings that go back to her choldhood during the 1950's. She has decided to use som e Javascript data she received to create a Webpage for her story and to make the data available to others. We will build a dynamic Webpage by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page. It will also be important to draw upon my knowledge of CSS and Boootstrap to build and style the page for consistent functionality. I'll also use ChromeDev tools to test the code created for the Webpage.

Specifically, I am going to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria. The page will display Dana's article and give those who visit her page the opportunity to interact with the data and search for UFO sightings based on defined criteria. This will be a wonderful opportunity to assist Dana in creating a useable tool for those who are interested in searching for UFO sightings that occurred throughout the United States.

## Results 
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

UFOS
Using Javascript, bootstrap to make a UFO sightings page

Overview of the Project
For this project we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. We want to use filters since we have many different sightings that occurred throughout the U.S.-- based on the different areas or what type of shape of the sighting.

HTML Page and our results
Screen Shot 2020-10-03 at 11 08 01 AM

Once entering the website our client will see the basic opening and title with the picture at the top, as the client scrolls down they will begin to see all the data and filters that we have(which is in the image below). From this image below we have 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. You can choose any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

filters

Summary
We have created a page that looks clean and allows the user to filter through the different sitings in our data set using the search bars created. One big drawback about our search bar is trying to validate the sitings that happened which can be better described in the data. If we had how many people were at the siting would be a helpful element to validating the claims. Having as much data as possible for website would make it as good as it can possible be. My two recommendations for improving this website would 1. to have more data that has more information including how many people were at the site 2. adding another filter to find the sitings by lengt and last but not least have a site that would be constantly updating our data adding new sitings to our page.
